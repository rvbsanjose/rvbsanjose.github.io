Full-stack software engineer fluent in Ruby, Rails, server and client-side JavaScript. Using todayâ€™s best-practices to develop web applications, I ensure my projects focus on modularity and reusability; are well-designed, maintainable, readable, and efficient to transform product requirements into robust web applications.

As a strong team player, I have learned soft skills that are integral to being a successful software developer to facilitate effective development cycles. I have an appreciation for pair programming, behavioral and test-driven development, refactoring, continuous integration, and working within an agile environment.
